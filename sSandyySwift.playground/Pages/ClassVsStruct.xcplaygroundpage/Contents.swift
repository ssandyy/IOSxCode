// Class(Heap memory) is refrence type  but structure/struct (Stack memory) is value type

//-------------------------------   class  ---------------------------
//Class are slower then struct
//Classes are stored in the heap memory
//Objects in class are in heap and are in refrence type
//Refrence type point to an object in memory and update the object in memory

//-------------------------------   Sruct  ---------------------------
//Struct are fast! (because of stack memory allocation)
//struct are Stored in stack memory
//Object in struct are Value Type
//Value type are copied & mutated
